            source projects. It’s successful because it’s so widely used; it’s important because the
            security of large parts of the Internet infrastructure relies on it. The project
            consists of a high-performance implementation of key cryptographic algorithms, a
            complete SSL/TLS and PKI stack, and a command-line toolkit. I think it’s safe to say
            that if your job has something to do with security, web development, or system
            administration, you can’t avoid having to deal with OpenSSL on at least some level. The
            majority of the Internet is powered by open source products, and virtually all of them
            rely on OpenSSL.</p><p id="PN10056">This book covers two ways in which OpenSSL can be used. <a class="xref" href="ch-openssl.html" title="OpenSSL Cookbook: Chapter 1. OpenSSL">Chapter 1, <em>OpenSSL</em></a>,
            will help users who need to perform routine tasks of key and certificate generation, and
            configure programs that rely on OpenSSL for SSL/TLS functionality. This chapter also
            discusses how to create a complete private CA, which is useful for development and
            similar internal environments. <a class="xref" href="ch-testing-with-openssl.html" title="OpenSSL Cookbook: Chapter 2. Testing with OpenSSL">Chapter 2, <em>Testing with OpenSSL</em></a>, focuses on
            server security testing using OpenSSL. Although sometimes time consuming, this type of
            low-level testing can’t be avoided when you wish to know exactly what’s going on. </p><p id="PN1005E">Both chapters are borrowed from my larger work, called <em>Bulletproof SSL and
                TLS</em>. I decided to publish the OpenSSL chapters as a
            separate free book because good documentation is always in great demand. This is
            particularly true for OpenSSL, which is not very well documented; what you can find on
            the Internet is often wrong and outdated.</p><p id="PN10067">Besides, publishers often give away one or more chapters in order to show what the
            book is like, and I thought I should make the most of this practice by not only making
            the OpenSSL chapters free, but also by committing to continue to maintain and improve
            them over time. So here they are.</p><div class="section" title="Feedback"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="N10069"/><a class="heading-link" href="preface.html#N10069">Feedback</a></h2></div></div></div><p id="PN1006C">Reader feedback is always very important, but especially so in this case, because
                this is a living book. In traditional publishing, often years pass before reader
                feedback goes back into the book, and then only if another edition actually sees the
                light of day (which often does not happen for technical books, because of the small
                market size). With this book, you’ll see new content appear in a matter of days.
                Ultimately, what you send to me will affect how the book will evolve.</p><p id="PN1006E">The best way to contact me is to use my email address,
                    <em>ivanr@webkreator.com</em>. Sometimes I may also be able to
                respond via Twitter, where you will find me under the handle
                    <em>@ivanristic</em>. </p></div><div class="section" title="About Bulletproof SSL and TLS"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="N10076"/><a class="heading-link" href="preface.html#N10076">About Bulletproof SSL and TLS</a></h2></div></div></div><p id="PN10079"><em>Bulletproof SSL and TLS</em> is the book I wish I had back when I
                was starting to use SSL. I don’t remember when that was exactly, but it was
                definitely very early on, back when you still had to patch Apache to get it to
                support SSL. What I do remember is how, in 2005, when I was writing my first book,
                    <em>Apache Security</em>, I started to appreciate the complexities
                of cryptography. I even began to like it.</p><p id="PN10080">In 2009 I started to work on SSL Labs, and for me, the world of cryptography began
                to unravel. Fast-forward a couple of years, and in 2015 I am still learning.
                Cryptography is a unique field in which the more you learn, the less you
                know.</p><p id="PN10082">In supporting SSL Labs users over the years, I realized that there was a lot
                written on SSL/TLS and PKI, but that the material generally suffered from two
                problems: (1) all you need is not in one
                place, making the little bits and pieces (e.g., RFCs) difficult to find, and
                    (2) most of it is very detailed and
                low level. Many documents are also obsolete. I tried to make sense of it all and it
                took me years of work and study to even begin to understand the ecosystem.</p><p id="PN1008C"><em>Bulletproof SSL and TLS</em> addresses the documentation gap. It’s
                a practical book that starts with a gentle introduction and a solid theory
                background, but then moves to discuss everything  you need for your daily work. It
                also provides deep coverage of certain key aspects, for example protocol attacks.
                For those who want even more, there are hundreds of references to research papers
                and other external resources.</p></div><div class="section" title="About the Author"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="N10090"/><a class="heading-link" href="preface.html#N10090">About the Author</a></h2></div></div></div><p id="PN10093">Ivan Ristić is a security researcher, engineer, and author, known especially for
