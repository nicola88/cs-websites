			publication I began

        time and dedication. In my experience, most people don’t need to know everything, but it’s
        tricky to find the small bits that they do need to know. For these individuals, I maintain
        this guide: the smallest possible document that could reasonably claim to give a complete
        picture of the problems facing someone who wishes to deploy a secure SSL/TLS server.</p><div class="section" title="1 Private Key and Certificate"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="N10D97"/><a class="heading-link" href="apA-ssl-tls-deployment-best-practices.html#N10D97">1 Private Key and Certificate</a></h3></div></div></div><p id="PN10D9B">In TLS, all security starts with the server’s cryptographic identity; a strong private
		            key is needed to prevent attackers from carrying out impersonation attacks. Equally
		            important is to have a valid and strong certificate, which grants the private key the
		            right to represent a particular hostname. Without these two fundamental building blocks,
		            nothing else can be secure.</p><div class="section" title="1.1 Use 2048-Bit Private Keys"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="N10D9D"/><a class="heading-link" href="apA-ssl-tls-deployment-best-practices.html#N10D9D">1.1 Use 2048-Bit Private Keys</a></h4></div></div></div><p id="PN10DA1">For most web sites, security provided by 2,048-bit RSA keys is sufficient. The RSA
		                public key algorithm is  widely supported, which makes keys of this type a safe
		                default choice. At 2,048 bits, such keys provide about 112 bits of security. If you
		                want more security than this, note that RSA keys don’t scale very well. To get 128
		                bits of security, you need 3,072-bit RSA keys, which are noticeably slower. ECDSA
		                keys provide an alternative that offers better security and better performance. At
		                256 bits, ECDSA keys provide 128 bits of security. A small number of older clients
		                don’t support ECDSA, but modern clients do. It’s possible to get the best of both
		                worlds and deploy with RSA and ECDSA keys simultaneously if you don’t mind the
		                overhead of managing such a setup.</p></div><div class="section" title="1.2 Protect Private Keys"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="N10DA3"/><a class="heading-link" href="apA-ssl-tls-deployment-best-practices.html#N10DA3">1.2 Protect Private Keys</a></h4></div></div></div><p id="PN10DA7">Treat your private keys as an important asset, restricting access to the smallest
		                possible group of employees while still keeping your arrangements practical.
		                Recommended policies include the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p id="PN10DAB">Generate private keys on a trusted computer with sufficient entropy. Some
		                        CAs offer to generate private keys for you; run away from them.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p id="PN10DAE">Password-protect keys from the start to prevent compromise when they are
		                        stored in backup systems. Private key passwords don’t help much in
		                        production because a knowledgeable attacker can always retrieve the keys
		                        from process memory. There are hardware devices (called <em class="firstterm">Hardware
		                            Security Modules</em>, or HSMs) that can protect private keys
		                        even in the case of server compromise, but they are expensive and thus
		                        justifiable only for organizations with strict security requirements.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p id="PN10DB4">After compromise, revoke old certificates and generate new keys.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p id="PN10DB7">Renew certificates yearly, and more often if you can automate the process.
		                        Most sites should assume that a compromised certificate will be impossible
		                        to revoke reliably; certificates with shorter lifespans are therefore more
		                        secure in practice.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p id="PN10DBA">Unless keeping the same keys is important for public key pinning, you
		                        should also generate new private keys whenever you’re getting a new

		                Your goal is to avoid invalid certificate warnings, which confuse users and weaken
		                their confidence.</p><p id="PN10DC2">Even when you expect to use only one domain name, remember that you cannot control
		                how your users arrive at the site or how others link to it. In most cases, you
		                should ensure that the certificate works with and without the
		                    <em>www</em> prefix (e.g., that it works for both
		                    <em>example.com</em> and <em>www.example.com</em>). The
		                rule of thumb is that a secure web server should have a certificate that is valid
		                for every DNS name configured to point to it.</p><p id="PN10DCD">Wildcard certificates have their uses, but avoid using them if it means exposing
		                the underlying keys to a much larger group of people, and especially if doing so
		                crosses team or department boundaries. In other words, the fewer people there are
		                with access to the private keys, the better. Also be aware that certificate sharing
		                creates a bond that can be abused to transfer vulnerabilities from one web site or
		                server to all other sites and servers that use the same certificate (even when the

		            advise that you use a comprehensive SSL/TLS assessment tool initially to verify your
		            configuration to ensure that you start out secure, and then periodically to ensure that
		            you stay secure. For public web sites, we recommend the free SSL Labs server test.<a href="apA-ssl-tls-deployment-best-practices.html#ftn.N10F54" id="N10F54" class="footnote">22</a></p></div><div class="section" title="6 Advanced Topics"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="N10F5A"/><a class="heading-link" href="apA-ssl-tls-deployment-best-practices.html#N10F5A">6 Advanced Topics</a></h3></div></div></div><p id="PN10F5E">The following advanced topics are currently outside the scope of our guide. They

		                        operators the means to restrict which CAs can issue certificates for their
		                        web sites. This feature has been deployed by Google for some time now
		                        (hardcoded into their browser, Chrome) and has proven to be very useful in
		                        preventing attacks and making the public aware of them. In 2014, Firefox
		                        also added support for hardcoded pinning. A standard called
		                            <em class="firstterm">Public Key Pinning Extension for HTTP</em><a href="apA-ssl-tls-deployment-best-practices.html#ftn.N10F6E" id="N10F6E" class="footnote">23</a> is now available. Public key pinning addresses the biggest
		                        weakness of PKI (the fact that any CA can issue a certificate for any web
		                        site), but it comes at a cost; deploying requires significant effort and
		                        expertise, and creates risk of losing control of your site (if you end up
		                        with invalid pinning configuration). You should consider pinning largely
		                        only if you’re managing a site that might be realistically attacked via a
		                        fraudulent certificate.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">DNSSEC and DANE</span></dt><dd><p id="PN10F79"><em class="firstterm">Domain Name System Security Extensions</em> (DNSSEC) is
		                        a set of technologies that add integrity to the domain name system. Today,
		                        an active network attacker can easily hijack any DNS request and forge
		                        arbitrary responses. With DNSSEC, all responses can be cryptographically
		                        tracked back to the DNS root. <em class="firstterm">DNS-based Authentication of Named

		                        augment the security of the existing CA-based PKI ecosystem or bypass it
		                        altogether.</p><p id="PN10F80">Even though not everyone agrees that DNSSEC is a good direction for the
		                        Internet, support for it continues to improve. Browsers don’t yet support
		                        either DNSSEC or DANE (preferring similar features provided by HSTS and HPKP
		                        instead), but there is some indication that they are starting to be used to
