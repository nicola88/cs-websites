  chapter called "The Roots" that included some of the field's most
  seminal papers.  How could you eliminate that material from this
  edition?!</b>  <br>
  This was a difficult decision for two reasons.  First, the
  well-educated database researcher should have an intimate
  familiarity with this work because it shaped the field and continues to
  frame much of the discussion.  Second, it is educational for researchers
  today to read these original papers and attempt to enter the
  mindset of the researchers working on the early systems, especially
  to see how they wrestled with the as-yet unformed structure of the
  design space. (The INGRES papers are especially nice
  in that regard.)   Unfortunately, I found that teaching these papers
  -- especially as the first papers in the class -- was a turnoff for
  many of today's students.  It is fairly difficult to separate the
  wheat from the chaff in these papers on first reading, and they do not
  give students a good sense of the structure of the field that
  emerged from this work.  Our new introductory chapter attempts to
  better set the stage of the field, and put the remaining papers into
  context.  We encourage serious database experts to go read the
  seminal papers as well.

  curriculum no longer follows this book.  What is the story
  there?</b>  <br>
  Traditionally, Berkeley had graduate-level reading/project courses
  in both Operating Systems (CS262) and Databases (CS286).  Through
  editions 1-3, <i>Readings in Database Systems</i> reflected the CS286
  database course at Berkeley.<p>

  During that period, a large fraction of the students took graduate
  OS, and a more select group took Databases.  In 1999, <a
  href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~brewer">Eric Brewer</a> and I
  tried an experiment where we merged the curricula of these two
  courses into a single course offering, spread over two semesters.
  The idea was to provide students (and the instructors!) a more
  holistic view of software systems by looking at core issues through
  the lens of two different communities.  We alternated giving
  lectures, attending each other's lectures and heckling from the
  audience to highlight the differences in worldview between OS and DB
  researchers.  This role-playing stimulated good student discussion
  and shed light on a larger computer systems design space than is
  traditionally considered by either community. <p>

  The newly retooled course was very well received by students, and
  there have been significant tangible results in the database and
  systems research coming out of Berkeley in the last five years. It
  has also changed my research thought processes in a positive way. I
  recommend the joint course highly, especially when coupled with
  advanced topics courses in databases.  <p>

  In recent years, we have only offered the first semester of the
  course jointly.  We are leaning toward reinstituting an advance
  CS286 to cover the remaining DB material in more depth during the
  second semester.<p>

  A recent web page for the course is up at <a
  href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~brewer/cs262/">Eric Brewer's
  website</a>.
